       <h3><em>What does "mental health" mean ? 🧐</em></h3> 

       <br/> Mental health is defined as the state of mental balance and well-being of a person at a given time. 
       <br/> It is about how you feel, think, act and interact with the surrounding world.
       <br/>Being in good mental health allows us to reach our full potential, cope with normal life stresses and contribute to our community.

       <h3><em>Why is mental health important ? 🧠</em></h3> 

       <br/>More than 450 million people suffer from mental disorders. According to WHO, by the year 2020, depression will constitute the second largest disease burden worldwide (Murray & Lopez, 1996).<br/>
       Global burden of mental health will be well beyond the treatment capacities of developed and developing countries.  The social and economic costs associated with growing burden of mental ill health focused the possibilities for promoting mental health as well as preventing and treating mental illness.<br/>
       Thus the Mental Health is linked to behaviour and seen as fundamental to physical health and quality of life.<br/>

      <br/> ☞ Community help : As well as getting the best treatments you can, find out what support is available in the community that suits your individual needs. Everyone is unique and it’s important to find the kind of support that helps you best at any one time.
